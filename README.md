# Arduino-projects
I had internship program where I played around with Arduino. Made some nice projects

Detail description for each project is located in project files

I personally like 6th project most because it integrated many hardware parts (display, 4 sensors, clock, SD card) with small code.
7th and 8th project are also working nicely, but their code lines went little too big. I wish their code could look more nicer.
