# Arduino-projects
I had internship program where I played around with Arduino. Made some nice projects

Detail description for each project is located in project files

I personally like 6th project most because it integrated many hardware parts (display, 4 sensors, clock, SD card) and code is easy to read.
7th and 8th project are also working nicely, but their code lines went little too big. Because of that it was getting hard to include new features for them.
